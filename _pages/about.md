<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently at Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Soochow University, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Juntao Li(李俊涛)](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang(张民)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CncXH-YAAAAJ).

Before this, I received my Bachelor’s degree (2018-2022, computer science) from Soochow University.

I am currently working as a research intern at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) General Technology Research under the mentorship of [Xiaoye Qu(瞿晓晔)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rT3hqdcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Yu Cheng(成宇)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORPxbV4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).




🤔 My research interests primarily revolve around a range of problems related to ***"time"***, including, but not limited to:
- **Temporal Adaptation and Generalization:** Investigating strategies to update LLMs for enhanced temporal adaptation, aiming to improve their ability to generalize to future contexts and ensure robustness in the temporal dimension.
- **Impact of Temporal Knowledge Dynamics:** Exploring the effects of temporal knowledge becoming outdated and the subsequent updating process in the parametric memory of LLMs. How do these updates influence or lead to hallucination within the model?
- **Temporal Reasoning in LLMs:** Enhancing LLMs' comprehension of time, including basic temporal concepts understanding (e.g., duration, frequency) and intricate temporal interpretations and computations (e.g., causality, arithmetic).

📖 *Can the progress of civilization, the advancement of technology truly transcend time? Or are we just endlessly persuing the elusive dust in the hourglass?*

🤝 Recently, I develop a fascination with analyses concerning the interpretability of LLMs. If you're interested in discussing these topics or are considering collaboration, feel free to drop me a message!

# 🎨 Miscellaneous
I have a wide range of interests in sports, music, photography, and reading. Without any special circumstances, I exercise for 1 hour every day. Recently, I am particularly fond of tennis, cross-fit, and swimming. I also have a strong interest in philosophy. The blog I created about [Marx. Weber](https://zhihu.com/question/31833873/answer/2516624337) has received over 11k views. Additionally, I am passionate about R&B and Jazz.
