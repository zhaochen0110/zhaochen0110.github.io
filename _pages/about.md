Hi, I am Zhaochen Su (苏肇辰), an incoming PhD student co-supervised by [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) and [Prof. May Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology starting in the fall of 2025.

Currently, I am a third-year master student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Soochow University, advised by [Prof. Juntao Li](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang](https://zhangmin-nlp-ai.github.io/).

Before this, I received my Bachelor’s degree (2018-2022, computer science) from Soochow University.

At present, I am working as a research intern at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) under the mentorship of [Xiaoye Qu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rT3hqdcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Yu Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORPxbV4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).




🤔 My research interests are primarily focused on exploring various challenges related to the dynamic of **"time"** in machine learning. Currently, my main focus is on Large Language Models (LLMs), covering the following topics:
- **Adaptation and Generalization:** Focusing on the reasons behind model degradation in time and exploring the strategies to improve temporal generalization and update the knowledge without catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge.
- **Trustworthiness and Reliability:** Investigation into the behavior of LLMs when encountering knowledge
conflicts and exploring methods to mitigate knowledge conflicts of old knowledge as we update LLMs with new knowledge.
- **Complex reasoning:** Research on equipping LLMs with human-level temporal reasoning and commonsense. This involves
basic temporal concepts understanding and intricate temporal interpretations and computations.

📖 *Can the progress of civilization, and the advancement of technology truly transcend time? Or are we just endlessly pursuing the elusive dust in the hourglass?*

# 🎨 Miscellaneous
I’m passionate about two things: social volunteering and sports! With over 600 hours of volunteering experience, I’ve had the privilege of serving as the Student Council President and interning at the United Nations. In my downtime, staying active is my go-to. Without any special circumstances, I make sure to exercise for at least an hour every day. Some of my favorite activities include 🏋️ fitness, 🏓 table tennis, 🎾 tennis, 🏃 running, 🚴 cycling, and 🥾 hiking. For me, there’s nothing quite like the thrill of pushing my limits and enjoying the outdoors!
