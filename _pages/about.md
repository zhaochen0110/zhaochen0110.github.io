I have a wide range of interests in sports, music, photography, and reading. Without any special circumstances, I exercise for 1 hour every day. Recently, I am particularly fond of tennis, cross-fit, and swimming. I also have a strong interest in philosophy. The blog I created about [Marx. Weber](https://zhihu.com/question/31833873/answer/2516624337) has received over 11k views. Additionally, I am passionate about R&ampB and Jazz.
