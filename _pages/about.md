<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I am Zhaochen Su (苏肇辰), an incoming PhD student co-supervised by [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) and [Prof. May Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) starting in the fall of 2025.

I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Soochow University, advised by [Prof. Juntao Li](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang](https://zhangmin-nlp-ai.github.io/).

🧠 In the era of generative AI, I am passionate about understanding knowledge and reasoning in LLM/LVLM. My work has explored the mechanisms of model knowledge (ConflictBank), the adaptation to time-sensitive knowledge (LMLM, SG-TLM), and universal temporal reasoning (CotempoQA, Timo).

🤖 Now, in the era of agentic AI, I am highly interested in the next generation of multimodal agent models. My current focus is on training complex, human-like think-act models that leverage advanced and diverse multimodal toolsets (Openthinkimg).

📖 *Can the progress of civilization, and the advancement of technology truly transcend time? Or are we just endlessly pursuing the elusive dust in the hourglass?* — Just some of my thoughts.

# 🎨 Miscellaneous
I’m passionate about photography, philosophy, and sports. Staying active is a daily priority for me — some of my go-to activities include 🏋️ fitness, 🏓 table tennis, 🎾 tennis, 🏃 running, 🚴 cycling, and 🥾 hiking. I love the challenge of pushing my limits and exploring the outdoors. If you’re into fitness too, feel free to reach out to me, and let’s keep each other motivated!
