<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I am Zhaochen Su (苏肇辰), an incoming PhD student co-supervised by [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) and [Prof. May Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology starting in the fall of 2025.

Currently, I am a third-year master student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Soochow University, advised by [Prof. Juntao Li](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang](https://zhangmin-nlp-ai.github.io/).

Before this, I received my Bachelor’s degree (2018-2022, computer science) from Soochow University.

At present, I am working as a research intern at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) under the mentorship of [Xiaoye Qu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rT3hqdcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Yu Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORPxbV4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).


🤔 I aim to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge and reasoning in LLM/LVLM, paving the way toward more interpretable, adaptive, and human-like AI.

📖 *Can the progress of civilization, and the advancement of technology truly transcend time? Or are we just endlessly pursuing the elusive dust in the hourglass?*

# 🎨 Miscellaneous
I’m passionate about two things: social volunteering and sports! With over 600 hours of volunteering experience, I’ve had the privilege of serving as the Student Council President and interning at the United Nations. In my downtime, staying active is my go-to. Without any special circumstances, I make sure to exercise for at least an hour every day. Some of my favorite activities include 🏋️ fitness, 🏓 table tennis, 🎾 tennis, 🏃 running, 🚴 cycling, and 🥾 hiking. For me, there’s nothing quite like the thrill of pushing my limits and enjoying the outdoors!
