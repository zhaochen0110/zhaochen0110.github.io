<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Soochow University, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Juntao Li(李俊涛)](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang(张民)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CncXH-YAAAAJ).

Before this, I received my Bachelor’s degree (2018-2022, computer science) from Soochow University.

I am currently working as a research intern at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) General Technology Research under the mentorship of [Xiaoye Qu(瞿晓晔)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rT3hqdcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Yu Cheng(成宇)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORPxbV4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).




🤔 My research interests are primarily focused on exploring various challenges related to the dynamic of **"time"** in machine learning. Currently, my main focus is on Large Language Models (LLMs), covering the following topics:
- **Adaptation and Generalization:** Focusing on the reasons behind model degradation in time and exploring the strategies to improve temporal generalization and update the knowledge without catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge.
- **Trustworthiness and Reliability:** Investigation into the behavior of LLMs when encountering knowledge
conflicts and exploring methods to mitigate knowledge conflicts of old knowledge as we update LLMs with new knowledge.
- **Complex reasoning:** Research on equipping LLMs with human-level temporal reasoning and commonsense. This involves
basic temporal concepts understanding and intricate temporal interpretations and computations.

📖 *Can the progress of civilization, and the advancement of technology truly transcend time? Or are we just endlessly pursuing the elusive dust in the hourglass?*

🤝 **I'm looking for a PhD position in 2025 Fall. Don't hesitate to email me if there is a potential opportunity!**
