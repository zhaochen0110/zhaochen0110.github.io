<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I am Zhaochen Su (苏肇辰), an incoming PhD student co-supervised by [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) and [Prof. May Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology starting in the fall of 2025.

Currently, I am a third-year master student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Soochow University, advised by [Prof. Juntao Li](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang](https://zhangmin-nlp-ai.github.io/).

Before this, I received my Bachelor’s degree (2018-2022, computer science) from Soochow University.

At present, I am working as a research intern at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) under the mentorship of [Xiaoye Qu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rT3hqdcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Yu Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORPxbV4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).


🤔 I aim to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge and reasoning in LLM/LVLM, paving the way toward more interpretable, adaptive, and human-like AI.

📖 *Can the progress of civilization, and the advancement of technology truly transcend time? Or are we just endlessly pursuing the elusive dust in the hourglass?*

# 🎨 Miscellaneous
I’m passionate about photography, philosophy, and sports. Staying active is a daily priority for me — some of my go-to activities include 🏋️ fitness, 🏓 table tennis, 🎾 tennis, 🏃 running, 🚴 cycling, and 🥾 hiking. I love the challenge of pushing my limits and exploring the outdoors. If you’re into fitness too, feel free to add me on Apple Watch (friend code: 8615952695009), and let’s keep each other motivated!
